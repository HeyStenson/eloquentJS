// Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase B characters are in the string.
// Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except that it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted. Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
// Hint: use charAt(N) to get the Nth character from a string.
